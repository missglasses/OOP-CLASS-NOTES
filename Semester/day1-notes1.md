## ABSTRACTION 

inherent before accessing it

in an abstract method, you dont define the body 

whatever the parent class has, the child has to implement it

```ex: abstract void makeSound();```

## ACCESS MODIFIERS

private - accessible only within the same class
protected - within package or outside class using the child class. how? inherent it
public - make packages accessible
default - if no private, protected, public, etc., it is set to default ; accessible within the package
